							<h2>Experience & skills</h2>
							<p>I took a 10 week course in game development at Boden Gamecamp where I got an A in programming and B in Interface design. I'm comfortable in the language C# and working in Unity.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Programming</h3>
									<p>Back when I still went to the gymnasium for technology, I started off learning java before exploring other options. Following that, I learned how to utilize C# to develop games both during my freetime as well as during my time at Boden Gamecamp.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>UI Design</h3>
									<p>During my time at Boden, I also learned how to develop a seamless user interface (UI)  in video games that was well received by both my teachers and my peers. In all my projects I have worked to design the UI to be visually appealing as well as scripted flawlessly.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Languages</h3>
									<p>I can communicate perfectly both in speech and text using both Swedish & English; Swedish is my main language and English is my secondary language. I chose to improve and  "master" English  because of the tens of thousands of hours i've spent playing games in different communities around the world.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Project lead</h3>
									<p>In the group projects of my game development studies, I took on the role of lead programmer as well as project lead. This has helped me improve skill sets such as organization, planning and assigning tasks to group members, and time management. This process helped me discover that i'm a natural leader when it comes to completing group-oriented tasks.</p>
